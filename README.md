## About

Potree is a free open-source WebGL based point cloud renderer for large point clouds.
It is based on the [TU Wien Scanopy project](https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/projects/Scanopy/)
and it was part of the [Harvest4D Project](https://harvest4d.org/).

## Build

Make sure you have [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed

Install all dependencies, as specified in package.json,
then, install the gulp build tool:

    npm install -g gulp
    npm install -g rollup
    cd /var/www/potree
    npm install --save

Use the ```gulp watch``` command to

* create ./build/potree
* watch for changes to the source code and automatically create a new build on change
* start a web server at localhost:1234. Go to http://localhost:1234/examples/ to test the examples.

```
gulp watch
```
Note: If you use Visual Studio Code, to avoid a potential conflict with VSC exceeding the file watch limit and preventing potree from starting, run `echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p`.

## Deploy

Deploy potree to the EC2 instances serving the Veritas sites:

Active EC2 instances (as of 2020-04-24):

| Name                     | Keypair            | Potree Location   | Description |
| ------------------------ | ------------------ | ----------------- | ----------- |
| `prod.viz.nextdroid.com` | `NextDroidDev.pem` | `/var/www/potree` | "Production" server - runs everywhere right now, except |
|  `dev.viz.nextdroid.com` | `NextDroidDev.pem` | `/var/www/potree` | "Development" server - running on dev, demo, and test sites |

Steps for deploying (primarily for Veritas Dev server):
[Bob has been deploying more simply, by downloading the .zip file from GitHub to his laptop, then scp'ing the zip file to the server, unzipping, stoppig nginx, moving it to the right place, then restarting nginx.]

1. ssh into the desired EC2 instance with the appropriate keypair  
2. Activate ssh-agent by running `eval $(ssh-agent -s)` and   
2.1.0 make a directory in the ~/.ssh folder like `[your_name]_rsa` to store your keys   
2.1.1 `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/[your_name]_rsa/id_rsa`   
2.1.2 `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/[your_name]_rsa/id_rsa`   
2.1.3 `ssh-add ~/.ssh/[your_name]_rsa/id_rsa`    
2.1.4 You can confirm that your key is added with `ssh-add -l` if you don't see anything, double check that you ran `eval $(ssh-agent -s)` and try again.  
2.1.5 `cat ~/.ssh/[your_name]_rsa/id_rsa.pub` and copy the public key (don't copy from vi since it can add extra characters!) then add your public key to github [Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).  
2.1.6  Check that your ssh-agent is connected to github: `ssh -vT git@github.com` this will show you a verbose debug output so you can see what's up if something went wrong with your keygen process.  
3. Once you have your github connection, checkout the appropriate branch in potree (see table above for potree location on ec2 instance).
4. Compile the code using `gulp watch`. Note this both compiles the code and launches a gulp server, however, we use an Nginx server for serving on TCP ports, so you can kill the process after compiling (which takes about 1-2 seconds).
5. Check the visualization in a private browser on [dev.vts.nextdroid.com](https://dev.vts.nextdroid.com) - if you do not use a private browser then you will likely not see the updated visualization due to browser caching.




Sample Walkthrough for deploying to Development Server:
```
ssh -i /path/to/NextDroidDev.pem ubuntu@18.208.171.218

## Inside EC2 instance:
eval $(ssh-agent -s)		# activate ssh-agent
ssh-add /path/to/id_rsa		# add your ssh private key
cd git/GroundTruthVisualization/external/potree/
git fetch
git checkout <branch>
gulp watch 					# let it compile then you can kill the process with ctrl-C
```
